# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project should adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) - except, for pre-releases PEP440 takes precedence.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **SKOS cache-serving** — `/api/skos/lookup` and `/api/skos/labels` now serve
  from the local SKOS cache (format-compatible with inventory-md's cache) and
  fall back to upstream REST APIs (AGROVOC Skosmos, DBpedia Lookup, Wikidata
  Action API) for cache misses
  - Cache directory controlled by `TINGBOK_CACHE_DIR` env var (default:
    `~/.cache/tingbok/`; SKOS sub-dir: `skos/`)
  - Cache TTL: 60 days (matches inventory-md)
  - `hierarchy` endpoint remains a 501 stub (recursive path-to-root requires
    SPARQL; deferred to a later phase)
- `make run` target starts the dev server with `TINGBOK_CACHE_DIR` pointing at
  the local inventory-md SKOS cache (`~/.cache/inventory-md`)
- `httpx` added as a main dependency (used for upstream REST calls)
